<h1>DIFFERENT BETWEEN DOCUMENT & WINDOW OBJECTS:</h1>

<h2>WINDOW OBJECTS:</h2>

<p> The Browser Object Model contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab. The topmost object in the BOM 
    is the window object representing the window or tab or an iframe sometimes. Window object has properties like browser 
    history, location and the deviceâ€™s screen etc. In case of multi tab browser, a window object represents a single tab,
     but some of its properties like innerHeight, innerWidth and methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window.</p>

<h2>DOCUMENT:</h2>

<p> When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The document object represents the whole
     html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). It is the root element that represents the html 
     document.</p>
